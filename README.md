# TV-Script-Generation

## Overview
TV Script Generation is a subset of a bigger problem: Dialogue Generation. This falls under the umbrella of Natural Language Processing. As the name suggests, the basic idea is to develop a model that can generate realistic scripts for performance arts. Depending on the training data, these scripts can be specific to one topic/show, or adapt to all themes.

In this project, I try to build a model that can generate a script for a short episode of the F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series.

## How to run
### Dependencies
1. PyTorch
2. nltk
3. Juptyer notebook

### Setup
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run jupyter notebook from the directory and follow the instructions on it. 
The models take a lot of time to train, and hence it is recommended to use GPUs if available.
